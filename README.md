# Web-app programming course project

This was a project which tested my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills which I acquired in this course. I had to follow some tasks which I had to implement in the final solution.

## Project composition

This project is divided into two parts:
  - HTML and CSS
  - JavaScript

### HTML and CSS

The HTML and CSS part may look like a complete mess if you look at the design, but I had to accomplish all of instructions(tasks) that were given in PDF file to me (structure of page, placement of elements, animations...).

### JavaScript

Javascript part is added a few weeks later after I had learned all necesarry to carry on with the project. In this part I had to add new login page into the project which will send requests to the server with some hardcoded user data. If the user provides correct credentials, redirect to the prviKolokvij.html page.
